Contributing
-------------

Before you contribute code to **oci-driver**, please make sure it conforms to the PSR2 coding standard (cf.
[Zend Framework coding standard](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-coding-standard)) and that the all unit tests still pass. The easiest way to contribute is to work on a your own fork than submit a pull request.
